The CIT 215 midterm project, [hosted here](https://elainexe.github.io/cit215_midterm/). A project to create a sample product page with various video games stored in an array. Constructors are used to make each product div, displaying some product information, and a popup comes up when a product is clicked on. The popup displays extra information about the game and can be dismissed by clicking anywhere.
